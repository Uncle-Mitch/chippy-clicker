# chippy-clicker

High school assignment project. This was made in 2019 where the brief was to develop a game to engage primary aged students in a particular subject area.

chippy clicker, based on the famous Cookie Clicker, was designed to educate students in Business and Mathematics.
UI inside the game hasn't been renamed to "chippy clicker" as the new name was only 'created' in 2023.

Code is written in C# and UI was developed in Visual Studio.
